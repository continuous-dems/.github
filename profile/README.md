# 👋 Welcome! ✨

This is the home for projects by the Continuously-Updated DEM (CUDEM) team.

We're in the progress of moving here from our previous home organization,
[`ciresdem`](https://github.com/ciresdem).

This is part of our effort to build an open source community around this work.

For the most up-to-date information about our community-building information, including
governance, roadmap, and more, check out our
[Team Compass](https://github.com/continuous-dems/team-compass)!

To get in touch with our community, please join us on our
[Zulip chat space](https://cudem.zulipchat.com)!
